# Adversarial Attacks on Graph Convolutional Transformers with EHR Data

This repository contains the code and datasets used in my thesis research on the application of adversarial attacks on Graph Convolutional Transformers (GCT) to medical informatics, specifically with the EHR Data.

## Project Structure

- `Data/`: This directory contains the datasets used in the experiments. (eICU Data)
- `DataProcessing1.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook for preprocessing the data used in the models. This will output a tfdata, used for easy computation in model
- `GCT_Final.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the Graph Convolutional Transformer model, training procedures, evaluation procedure, adversarial attack...etc.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the repository and instructions for setting up and running the code.

## Datasets

The data used in this project is from the MIMIC-III and eICU public healthcare datasets. Due to the sensitive nature of this data, it has been de-identified. For access to the MIMIC-III and eICU datasets, please follow the instructions on their respective official websites.
